### Project's Goal

My mission was to build a cloned Airbnb application. I created the same UI with significant features (calendar picker, mapbox). The Server Side Rendering was a technique i used to improve the loading time.

### Dev Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Calendar Picker
- Mapbox 
- Vercel

### Challenges

In this project the biggest struggle i faced was the Mapbox integration. I wasn't familiar with it but i wax extremely excited to figure out how it works.
