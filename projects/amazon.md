### Project's Goal

The project goal was to simply create a copy of Instagram. With a very high-level cloning style, my cloned Instagram enables you to like, to save and to comment posts. The authentication feature happens to be in my upcoming agenda!

### Dev Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel

### Challenges

Having a specific targeted design wasn't that easy! But certainly it was enjoyable & positively challenging!
