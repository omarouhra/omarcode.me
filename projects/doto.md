### Project's Goal

The purpose here is to create a simply awesome application that gives its user the chance to feel the quality of its time. It is a minimal interface including a randomly selected quote plus a cool option to switch to the dark mode. The storage is local and the selection of the quotes is done with API requests.

### Dev Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Vercel

### Challenges

In this project the biggest struggle i faced was the Mapbox integration. I wasn't familiar with it but i wax extremely excited to figure out how it works.
