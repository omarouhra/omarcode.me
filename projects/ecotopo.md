### Project's Goal

My mission was to design & code a website to introduce the British Corner Agency and to highlight their services seeking the best education experience in UK. The creation of the logo was my mission too!

### Challenges

From a design angle, the challenge was to combine the useful and the enjoyable. A lot of informations in a beautiful simple pattern was not the easiest plan! The coding phase was supported by modern CSS which made the code clean & well structured.
