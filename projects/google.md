### Project's Goal

The purpose of the project was to clone Google with a very high-level clone style. Including real requests to google search SSR server-side rendering and the pagination feature, coding a copy of Google was technically worthwhile.

### Dev Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel

### Challenges

The issue here was the integration of Google search engine API and the server-side rendering. Looking for the right documentation and ensuring its right application feels daunting! But again it is about trying and learning.
