          Hello! <br />
          if you're wondering who's the person behind this work, then this
          section is made for you! Let me just tell you that I am exactly like
          you at this point, I am always curious about what's behind the
          professional serious image of any project owner. The branding content
          is always perfectly curated, and this makes a lot of sense! That's why
          I considered this space to be just me, OMAR, your new friend!! Well..
          I was born in Morocco in a town called Agadir. And I grew up hating
          school ðŸ˜‚ . I could be wrong but I still have the same feeling! I
          adore creating beautiful things and sense the pride and the passion to
          share them. I'm a fan of minimalism! Next to coding and managing my
          lovely project, I love music, calligraphy and coffee!
